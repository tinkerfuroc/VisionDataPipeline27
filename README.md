# vision-sampler-pipeline

SAM3-driven video labeling for one user-chosen component per clip.
Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-vision-sampler-design.md`.

## Setup

    uv sync
    uv run vsp doctor          # torch build, GPU selection, bfloat16
    uv run vsp verify-weights  # converted SAM3 checkpoint is complete
    uv run pytest              # GPU tests skip themselves without CUDA + checkpoint

Python, torch (`2.14.0+cu126`) and transformers (`5.17.0`) are pinned in `pyproject.toml`.
Do not install torch from PyPI: its default build needs an NVIDIA driver >= 580.

Relative paths in the config (`project.data_root`, `sam3.model_dir`) are resolved against the
repository root, not the current working directory, so `vsp` can be run from any directory.

## Verified on this machine

- Date: 2026-09-20
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, driver 535.183.01, torch 2.14.0+cu126, transformers 5.17.0
- GPU smoke tests: 12 passed
- Peak VRAM, 24-frame propagate at 640x480: 2.47 GiB
- Text prompt "red circle" on the synthetic scene: 1 detection(s)

## Run the server

    HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 uv run vsp serve        # http://127.0.0.1:28000 ; the model loads in the background
    curl -s --noproxy '*' http://127.0.0.1:28000/api/health

`/api/health` shows `engine.loaded` and, if loading failed, the reason. Interactive API docs: `/docs`.
Importing, browsing and frame cleanup work without a GPU; prompting and propagation return 503 until the
engine is loaded, and 409 (with the running `job_id`) while a propagation job holds the GPU. A propagate
request also returns 409 with `job_id: "interactive"` if a prompt/accept/clear-range call is in flight;
retry. Deleting a clip also returns 409 (with the running `job_id`) while a GPU job runs, so a delete can
never race a propagation's writes. Cancelling an import job removes the partial clip it had started.

`POST /api/projects/{id}/export` starts an export job; body `{clips, formats, options}` → `202 {job_id}`.
It returns 400 for an invalid request (unknown format, no clips, a bad option) and 409 (with the running
`job_id`) while a propagation job runs, since propagation rewrites the very masks an export reads.

## Web GUI

Node 22 is installed with nvm (`source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` in a fresh shell).

    cd web && npm ci            # once
    npm run build               # writes web/dist, which `vsp serve` serves at http://127.0.0.1:28000/
    npm run dev                 # or: hot-reloading dev server on http://127.0.0.1:5173 (proxies /api and /ws to :28000)
    npm test                    # vitest

### Demo data

With the server running, `uv run python scripts/seed_demo.py` creates a project "demo" with a synthetic 40-frame clip
(a disc moving across the frame), labels frame 0 with one click and propagates forward, then prints the URL to open.
`--no-label` imports only.

### Exporting

An export lands under `data/exports/<export_id>/`: an `images/` directory holding one copy of every
exported frame, plus one directory per requested format — `yolo_seg/`, `yolo_det/`, `coco/` and/or
`masks/` — and an `export.json` manifest recording the resolved options, the clips exported (with their
per-split frame counts), the class map (`yolo_id`, `coco_id`, `mask_value` per class) and the train/val
image counts. The train/val split is always either per clip (whole clips held out for validation) or
contiguous (the tail of every clip held out), never random per frame: neighbouring video frames are
nearly identical, so a random per-frame split would leak validation frames into training. A cancelled or
failed export removes its directory rather than leaving a partial dataset behind.

Polygon and box coordinates share one convention in every format: continuous image coordinates, where pixel
`i` covers `[i, i + 1)`. An export refuses to start while a propagation is running (409), a clip cannot be
deleted while an export is reading it (409), and a request that turns out to have no usable mask at all is
reported as a failed job ("nothing to export"), because finding that out means reading the masks.

### Keyboard

`Enter` accept · `Esc` clear · `Z` undo click · `←/→` step · `Shift+←/→` ±10 · `Space` play/pause · `K` / `Shift+K`
next / previous keyframe · `G` next empty frame · `Del` delete or restore frame · `[` / `]` mark the first / last frame to clear · `M` mask overlay · mouse wheel zoom ·
middle-drag pan · right click = negative point.

### Manual QA checklist (run on real footage before trusting a dataset)

1. Import a video and a frame directory (try a stride > 1); cancel one import midway and confirm no clip appears.
2. Label by each method: clicks (add a negative click), a box dragged bottom-right → top-left plus a refining click,
   and a text phrase with several candidates. Check the "no usable mask" message on an empty region.
3. Propagate forward, backward and both from a mid-clip keyframe; press Stop during one and confirm the masks so far stay.
4. Let the object leave the frame: propagation should stop early and seek to the "lost at" frame.
5. Correct a bad frame mid-clip (it becomes a keyframe) and propagate again: the run must stop at the next keyframe.
6. Scrub the timeline and play at clip fps with the overlay on; delete a frame, restore it, prune the tail. Clear masks:
   Shift-drag a stretch of the timeline (or press `[` and `]`), check the button names the frames and the note counts
   the masks, clear them, and confirm the keyframes inside the stretch survive and the mark disappears.
7. Reload the page during a propagation: the panel should re-attach to the running job.
8. Stop the server: the banner says it is unreachable; start it without weights: the banner shows the reason and
   importing / cleanup still work.
9. Propagate twice in one page session (let the first run finish, then start a second from a keyframe) and reload
   the page partway through the second run: it must re-attach to the second job, not the first.
10. Open the same clip in two tabs; start a propagation in tab A, then click to prompt in tab B on a different clip:
    B must not move or show A's progress as its own.
11. Delete a keyframe: its marker disappears from the timeline and propagation is blocked from it until it is restored.
12. Read the timeline without relying on colour: masked runs are filled (in the class colour), frames without a mask
    are hollow, deleted frames are hatched and keyframes carry an amber diamond. Hover it for a thumbnail with the
    frame number and state. Zoom into the frame, then press Fit in the tool rail. Tab through the page: every control
    shows a focus ring.
13. Export (the "Export dataset" button on the Clips page): with two or more clips, move a clip between Training and
    Validation by hand and export all four formats; with one clip selected, check the note says the tail of the clip
    becomes the validation set. Cancel an export midway and confirm its folder under `data/exports/` is gone. Open
    `export.json`, then load the result in the tool you train with: `yolo_seg/data.yaml` or `yolo_det/data.yaml` in
    Ultralytics, `coco/annotations/instances_train.json` with pycocotools, and look at a few `masks/masks/` PNGs
    (pixel value = `mask_value` from the manifest's class map).
